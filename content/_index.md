# p5.quadrille.js

Welcome to the _visual computing_ course & book site.

## Goal

To study the process of creation and manipulation of a digital image of a modern visual application, using current hardware. Skills to be developed:

<!--

-->

* Information literacy.
* Organization, communication & collaboration.
* Curiosity & critical thinking.
* Problem solving, analytical reasoning & creativity.
* Self-direction.

## Methodology

Collaborative (rather than competitive) [active learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_learning) to complete the exercises selected by the different teams, to be developed in [java-script](https://www.javascript.com/) using [p5.js](https://p5js.org/).

{{< hint info >}}
**Requirements**   
1. Teams should be conformed of **three** people.
2. **Never use someone else's code** unless it's explicitly allowed. Doing so usually produces confusion.
3. The exercises should be presented in a [showcase](https://visualcomputing.github.io/showcase/),
written as [academic reports](https://www.wordy.com/writers-workshop/writing-an-academic-report/) having the following outline:
     * Intro & background
     * Code (solution) & results
     * Conclusions & future work
4. The exercises should be exposed publicly by **all** team mates.

{{< hint warning >}}
**Warning**   
Always properly [cite & attribute](https://opentextbc.ca/selfpublishguide/chapter/citation-vs-attribution/) third-party references (reports, books, cites, software, etc), including this site.

## Grading

Exercises.

{{< hint danger >}}
**Remarks**   
1. Grading feedback is **only** discussed personally in class soon after gradings take place.
2. Top gradings are **only** obtained when most of the exercises are completed & an in-depth study is carried out on a proposed subject.
3. External circumstances such as honors or grade point averages are **never** taking into account.
