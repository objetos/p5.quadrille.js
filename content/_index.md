# p5.quadrille.js

[p5.quadrille.js](https://github.com/objetos/p5.quadrille.js) is an open-source [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) library tailored for students, visual artists, and game designers. It supports the creation of [grid-based games](https://objetos.github.io/docs/intro/gbg/) and the exploration of visual algorithms.

Anchored in the [quadrille](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_tiling) concept, which is fundamental to numerous graphics applications, the library opens avenues for crafting traditional grid-based games and exploring algorithmic visuals from color data-based sorting to software-based image processing and rasterization.

At the heart of the library lies the `Quadrille` class, couple with some [p5.js functions]({{< ref "p5_functions" >}}) that allow manipulation and customization of all the quadrille visual appearance aspects. The class provides a set of [properties]({{< ref "properties" >}}), some read-only like [mouseRow]({{< ref "mouse_row" >}}), [mouseCol]({{< ref "mouse_col" >}}), [size]({{< ref "size" >}}) and [order]({{< ref "order" >}}), and others read-write such as [width]({{< ref "width" >}}), [height]({{< ref "height" >}}) and [memory2D]({{< ref "memory_2d" >}}). The class also offers methods to perform geometric [transformations]({{< ref "transforms" >}}), conduct [algebraic operations]({{< ref "algebra" >}}) inspired by [constructive solid geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructive_solid_geometry), and perform [visualizations]({{< ref "visual_algorithms" >}}) involving image filtering with [convolution matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_%28image_processing%29) and [triangle rasterization](https://fgiesen.wordpress.com/2013/02/06/the-barycentric-conspirac/). Additionally, the class includes various [accessors]({{< ref "accessors" >}}) such as [queries]({{< ref "queries" >}}), [cell contents]({{< ref "cell_contents" >}}), and [instance creators]({{< ref "instance_creators" >}}), along with [mutators]({{< ref "mutators" >}}) like [delete]({{< ref "delete" >}}), [insert]({{< ref "insert" >}}), [randomize]({{< ref "randomize" >}}), [rand]({{< ref "rand" >}}), [swap]({{< ref "swap" >}}), [replace]({{< ref "replace" >}}), [clear]({{< ref "clear" >}}), [fill]({{< ref "fill" >}}) and [sort]({{< ref "sort" >}}) (used to order the images within the logo above), which allow for detailed customization and manipulation of the quadrille's state. Moreover, [reformatters]({{< ref "reformatter" >}}) within the library enable seamless transformation between quadrille instances and various data formats, such as [arrays](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array), [images](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5.Image), [bitboards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitboard) and [Forsythâ€“Edwards Notation (FEN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forsyth%E2%80%93Edwards_Notation) chess board positions.

The library reference which illustrates most of its functionality is found along this site.
